# Matcher golden set fixtures

Recorded responses of the public [MangaUpdates API](https://api.mangaupdates.com) (v1), used by the
stage-2 matcher golden set (`tests/golden`). Series data (c) MangaUpdates - credited here as the
API's acceptable use policy asks. The tests replay these files; no test ever contacts the network.

- Every `search.*.json` / `series.*.json` file is copied unchanged (byte-identical) from MangaPixer
  1.31.1 (release commit `858c7df`, `tests/MangaPixer.Server.Tests/Features/Metadata/Fixtures/GoldenSet/`).
  MangaPixer recorded them with at least 0.75 s between requests, PUBLIC well-known titles only (never
  a name from a real library): the first set on 2026-09-26, one record for 1.26.1, page 2 of four
  searches, live-run lookalikes and `publishers[]` merged into three records for 1.27.0, image URLs in
  three searches for 1.28.0, and the spin-off, author-tagged alias and origin-tie searches for 1.30.0.
  No new requests were made for MangaList. MangaPixer's `covers.json` (cover hashes) is not copied:
  MangaList compares no covers.
- `search.<slug>.json`: `POST /v1/series/search` with `{search, page: 1, perpage: 10, filter_types}`;
  `search.<slug>.p2.json` is page 2 (the file carries `"page": 2`). `filter_types` is the fixed
  automatic-search filter (`Novel`, `Doujinshi`, `Artbook`, `Drama CD`); files ending in `.dj.json`
  were recorded with Doujinshi allowed. Each file keeps the query, the filter and the response trimmed
  to `total_hits` and, per result, `record.series_id, title, type, year` plus `hit_title`.
- `series.<id>.json`: `GET /v1/series/{id}`, trimmed to what the matcher reads: `series_id, title,
  associated[].title, type, year, status, latest_chapter, authors[] (name, type)`, the
  `Webtoon/Webcomic` category votes (when present), `related_series[] (relation_type,
  related_series_id)` and, where recorded, `publishers[] (publisher_name, type, notes)`.
- A missing fixture fails the case with the exact request it would need, so the set stays
  reproducible.
- `../mangapixer_report.txt` is MangaPixer's own result for the cases MangaList runs: MangaPixer's
  golden harness (production detector, planner, retrieval loop, provider mapping and scorer) run at
  `858c7df` over these recordings, printing per case the detector class, the band, chosen id, title /
  adjusted score and reasons, and the searches and GETs it sent, plus the aggregate lines at the
  default, loosest and strictest thresholds. The MangaList golden test compares its results with it
  line by line.
