"""The batch scheduler: runs each active job when its persisted due time arrives.

Semantics:

- **Planning.** A job that was never planned, or whose schedule changed since it was planned, is
  next due at the schedule's first slot after "now" (a new or edited schedule never fires at once).
- **After a run** the next due time is the first slot after the run FINISHED, so a slow run never
  queues a second one behind it.
- **Missed runs (downtime).** If the persisted due time has passed when the runner starts, the job
  runs ONCE right away (``catch_up``, the default) - however many slots were missed - and is then
  planned from that run. With ``catch_up`` off the missed slot is skipped and the job is planned
  from now.
- **Shutdown.** :meth:`Scheduler.stop` (SIGTERM / SIGINT) wakes the loop; a running job is asked
  to stop at its next check and is recorded as ``cancelled`` with its due time unchanged, so the
  next start catches it up once.
- **Clock.** The loop sleeps at most ``max_sleep`` seconds at a time and re-reads the clock, so a
  suspended host or a clock change is noticed within that time.
