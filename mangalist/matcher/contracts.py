"""The stage-2 matcher contract (port of MangaPixer 1.32.0 ``AutoMatchContracts.cs``).

Rules carried over unchanged (MangaPixer owner decisions, 2026-09-26): only folders the detector
classes as series-like are matched at folder level; archive-level matching only inside collection
folders, numbered mini-series grouped, author conflicts veto auto; ambiguous folders go to review,
never auto. Thresholds are bounded (``MatchThresholds``). Enum values are kept identical to the
reference so reasons and classes mean the same thing in both projects.
