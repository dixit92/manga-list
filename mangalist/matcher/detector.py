"""The work detector (port of MangaPixer 1.31.1 ``WorkDetector.cs``).

Classifies a folder from its shape alone - display names and counts, no IO - so only folders that
ARE one work are matched at folder level, collections are matched archive by archive (numbered
mini-series grouped), and anything unclear goes to review.

Order of the rules:

1. Depth 0 (the library root) is ``EXCLUDED``; a unit-named folder below a non-root parent
   (``Volumes``, ``Season 2``, ``Part 3``) is ``UNIT_SUB``.
2. Subfolders (empty ones ignored): two or more non-unit subfolders make a franchise container (at
   least half related to the parent's name, or ``Part N - subtitle`` children) or a collection
   container; exactly one makes a wrapper (no archives) or ``MIXED``; only unit subfolders make
   ``SERIES_WITH_UNITS``.
3. A leaf named like the creator its archives carry (the dominant ``[circle (artist)]`` tag) is an
   ``ARTIST_COLLECTION``.
4. One archive is a ``ONE_SHOT``.
5. The E6 discriminator on archive base titles: unit-named share >= 0.8, or one base title >= 80%,
   or >= 60% of the titled archives matching the folder -> ``SERIES``; distinct-base ratio >= 0.6
   with no base at 50% or more -> ``COLLECTION_LEAF``; otherwise ``AMBIGUOUS`` (review only).
6. A leaf of two or more archives that the discriminator did NOT call a series and whose name equals a
   caller-supplied provider author (``FolderShape.known_author_names``) is an ``ARTIST_COLLECTION`` (1.28.0).

Reasons never contain names (counts and shares only), so they are safe to log.
