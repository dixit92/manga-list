"""Stage-2 matcher: a Python port of MangaPixer 1.32.0's metadata auto-match core (the manga path; 1.32.0's
comics routing, Grand Comics Database evidence and comics candidate fields are not ported).

Pure (no Qt, no IO): the work detector decides what a folder is, the planner builds the query
variants and local evidence, the scorer ranks provider candidates and bands the result
(auto / needs review / unmatched), and the retrieval loop drives injected search / get calls.
Thresholds, vetoes and reasons are identical to the reference; the golden set in
``tests/golden`` checks that the bands and ids match MangaPixer's.
